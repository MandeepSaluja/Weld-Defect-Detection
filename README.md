Weld Defect Detection using Deep Learning with NDT Integration

**Overview:**
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based system for detecting weld defects, integrating Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques. Weld quality is critical in various industries such as manufacturing, construction, and aerospace, where defects can compromise structural integrity and safety. By leveraging deep learning algorithms and NDT methods, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weld defect detection processes.

**Key Features:**

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze images or sensor data for identifying weld defects.
Integration with NDT Techniques: Incorporates NDT methods such as ultrasonic testing (UT), radiographic testing (RT), magnetic particle testing (MPT), or dye penetrant testing (DPT) to supplement the deep learning model's analysis and improve defect detection accuracy.
Real-time Detection: Provides the capability for real-time or near-real-time detection of weld defects, enabling timely corrective actions and preventing potential safety hazards or production delays.
User Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, visualizing detected defects, and accessing relevant diagnostic information.


**Technologies Used:
**
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras for building and training deep learning models.
